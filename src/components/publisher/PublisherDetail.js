// a details page for each publisher
// name
// year founded
// description
// image up top

// here's a thought: include a button or link that says "see comics by {publisher.name}"
// this takes you to the browse section where all comics are listed and will be filtered
// but is automatically filtered by the publisher Id
// comic manager will need a getComicByPublisher call
